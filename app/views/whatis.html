		<h1>WTH is Caviar?</h1>

		<p>
			Caviar is a little framework to create Cordova Apps 
			in a simple way and with high performance. 
			It was created following some FastGap project techniques. 
			Our main concern is to keep everything simple and fast. 
		</p>

		<p>
			We have no intention to define standards of design for UI.
			We only want to provide a flow management system, 
			resources and some other magic.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you are asking yourself why this name, well, its a internal 
			joke of WEEDO.it's staff in reference to Zeca Pagodinho's song of same name.
